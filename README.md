# DE Python Tests

> For interviews in 2021 Q4.

This test is to assess your ability to write Python code and to discuss how you think about coding problems in the interview. Failing to fully complete the test in not a failure of the interview. The main purpose of this test is to know if you understand Python and then use this test as a discussion point in your interview with the panel.

There is a person on point who can clarify the test questions and solve technical issues. If anything is unclear or you are not sure if something is wrong, please ask them as soon as possible. Asking questions will not affect how we score you on the test, so it is better to ask sooner rather than later.

You are free to use the internet to solve these tests and you can install additional packages. However, the solutions to this test can be achieved using Python and it's standard libraries. This test is ran in Python 3.8.

## Doing the Tests

There are 4 scripts in the root of this repo/directory:

- step1.py
- step2.py
- step3.py
- step4.py

These scripts need to be completed in order. As `step2.py` is dependant on `step1.py` whilst `step3.py` is dependant on `step2.py` and `step1.py`, etc.

Within each script there will be a comment block starting with `[TODO]` which lays out what needs to be done to solve the test for that particular script. The remaining comments are there to explain the code and help direct you.

Once you think you have solved the script run `python script<#>.py` (where # needs to be replaced with the script's number), or if you have copied code into a notebook, run the cell. It will either say `SUCCESS` if your answer works as expected or it will say `FAILURE` with an explaination why. Once the ran script prints SUCCESS you should be able to move on to the next script in the test.

If you have any questions or technical issues please contact the person who has introduced the test to you. They are here to help and asking questions is not assessed towards this test.
